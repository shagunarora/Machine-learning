# Machine-learning-Basics
This repo is for getting hands on with octave programming language by implementing simple machine learning Algorithms and functions       :)
## 1. Sigmoid function
sigmoid function is generally used in classification problems in machine learning as its value ranges from (0,1). By looking the graph of sigmoid function below value of sigmoid function is 0.5 for x=0.

when value of x >= 0(or y >= 0.5) probability of occurence of an event is considered to be 1. for eg.y = 0.8 this means probability of occurence of event is 80% . For single line code of sigmoid function here is the source code : https://github.com/shagunarora/Machine-learning/blob/master/sigmoid.m 

## 2. Plotting Data
To be able to visualise the data properly before implementing any algorithm we need to plot the data.
